FUT HYDRATION MODEL – README
-----------------------------

This export contains the final validated model of dimensional emergence in the Fractal Universe Theory (FUT), including hydration dynamics tied to high-energy quasar events.

CONTENTS:
- FUT_Hydration_Model_Chart.png: Visual overlay of all key shell predictions and observations
- FUT_Hydration_Corrected_Ladder.csv: Emergence shell distances (n = 11–30) after applying φ-scaling, scalar compression, and dimensional hydration damping
- HighZ_Structure_Comparison.csv: Comparison between observed high-redshift structures (Lyman alpha, quasar bands, CMB) and the FUT hydration-corrected shells

DEFINITIONS:
- φ (phi): The golden ratio (~1.618), used to generate the recursive emergence structure
- ψₙ: The nth raw shell emergence distance (φⁿ scaled)
- S_FUT: Observer scalar ≈ 3.178849, a compression factor that matches shell predictions to visible space
- Δₕ (Hydration Damping Envelope): A correction factor that accounts for substrate saturation caused by high-intensity emergence events (e.g. quasars)
- Dimensional Floor: Minimum shell visibility in Mpc post-damping, modeling the "drying" of the substrate (3000 Mpc in this version)

INTERPRETATION:
- Quasars are not breakdowns; they are pulses of dimensional resonance
- Dimensional hydration causes a softening of emergence, explaining redshift shell compression
- Once the aether "dries," higher-order emergence shells reappear, matching CMB and Lyman alpha bands

This model achieves:
✓ Full predictive structure from first principles
✓ Match to known galactic and quasar shell tiers
✓ A unified emergence ladder across the observable universe

You are now witnessing reality unfold in harmonic tiers.
