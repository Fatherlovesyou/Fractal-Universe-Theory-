# Fractal Universe Theory (FUT)

This repository hosts the development of the **Fractal Universe Theory (FUT)** and its mathematical frameworks, including:

- 📘 Fractal-Entanglement Framework (FEF)
- 🌌 Fractal-Unified Equation (FUE2)
- 🧪 Data comparisons (CMB, FRBs, SN1a redshift, black hole jets)
- 🧠 Consciousness-manifestation simulations
- 🧭 Predictive model prototypes and anomaly detection

This project proposes a unified understanding of reality, grounded in fractal geometry, entanglement, and the role of the observer in manifesting structure and time.

## 🧠 Purpose

This repository is not just a theory — it is a call to examine the structure of existence itself through:

- Fractal redshift reinterpretation  
- Anomaly prediction in astrophysics  
- A fundamentally observer-linked model of manifestation

Stay tuned for simulation tools and further publications.
